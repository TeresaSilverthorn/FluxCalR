This R package is used to calculate CO2 and CH4 gas fluxes measured with static chamber method. It provide a 
    easy way to calculate multiple flux measurements in one data file together. The format of data input are specialized to 
    that of from Los Gatos Research (LGR) Ultraportable Gas Analyzers <http://www.lgrinc.com/analyzers/ultraportable/>. 
    A function is also provided to convert data from other sources (e.g. LICOR) into the format that is compatible with the function.
