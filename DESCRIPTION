Description: This R package is used to calculate CO2 and CH4 gas fluxes measured with static chamber method. It provide a easy way to calculate multiple flux measurements from one data file. The format of data input are specialized to that of from Los Gatos Research (LGR) Ultraportable Gas Analyzers <http://www.lgrinc.com/analyzers/ultraportable/>. A function is also provided to load and convert data from other sources (e.g. LICOR) into the format that is compatible with the flux calculation fuction.
